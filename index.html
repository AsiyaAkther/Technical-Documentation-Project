                <p>CSS is the acronym for "Cascading Style Sheet".</p>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning CSS:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create Stunning Web site - CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.</li>
                    <li>Become a web designer - If you want to start a carrer as a professional web designer, HTML and CSS designing is a must skill.</li>
                    <li>Control web - CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.</li>
                    <li>Learn other languages - Once you understands the basic of HTML and CSS then other related technologies like javascript, php, or angular are become easier to understand.</li>

                <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.</p>
                <p>CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page.

                <p><strong>Advantages of CSS:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSS saves time − You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.</li>
                    <li>Pages load faster − If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster download times.</li>
                    <li>Easy maintenance − To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.</li>
                    <li>Superior styles to HTML − CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="backgrounds">
                <h2>CSS Backgrounds</h2>
                <p>You can set backgrounds of various HTML elements. You can set the following background properties of an element −</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <code>background-color</code> property is used to set the background color of an element.</li>
                    <li>The <code>background-image</code> property is used to set the background image of an element.</li>
                    <li>The <code>background-repeat</code> property is used to control the repetition of an image in the background.</li>
                    <li>The <code>background-position</code> property is used to control the position of an image in the background.</li>
                    <li>The <code>background-attachment</code> property is used to control the scrolling of an image in the background.</li>
                    <li>The <code>background</code> property is used as a shorthand to specify a number of other background properties.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can use <code>no-repeat</code> value for <code>background-repeat</code> property if you don't want to repeat an image, in this case image will display only once.</p>
                <p>Background attachment determines whether a background image is fixed or scrolls with the rest of the page.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="paddings">
                <h2>CSS Paddings</h2>
                <p>The padding property allows you to specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border −</p>
                <p>The value of this attribute should be either a length, a percentage, or the word inherit. If the value is inherit, it will have the same padding as its parent element. If a percentage is used, the percentage is of the containing box.</p>
                <p>The following CSS properties can be used to control lists. You can also set different values for the padding on each side of the box using the following properties −</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <code>padding-bottom</code> specifies the bottom padding of an element.</li>
                    <li>The <code>padding-top</code> specifies the top padding of an element.</li>
                    <li>The <code>padding-left</code> specifies the left padding of an element.</li>
                    <li>The <code>padding-right<code> specifies the right padding of an element.</li>
                    <li>The <code>padding<code> serves as shorthand for the preceding properties.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="margins">
                <h2>CSS Margins</h2>
                <p>The margin property defines the space around an HTML element. It is possible to use negative values to overlap content.</p>
                <p>The values of the margin property are not inherited by the child elements. Remember that the adjacent vertical margins (top and bottom margins) will collapse into each other so that the distance between the blocks is not the sum of the margins, but only the greater of the two margins or the same size as one margin if both are equal.</p>
                <p>We have the following properties to set an element margin.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The margin specifies a shorthand property for setting the margin properties in one declaration.</li>
                    <li>The margin-bottom specifies the bottom margin of an element.</li>
                    <li>The margin-top specifies the top margin of an element.</li>
                    <li>The margin-left specifies the left margin of an element.</li>
                    <li>The margin-right specifies the right margin of an element.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="colors">
                <h2>CSS Colors</h2>
                <p>CSS uses color values to specify a color. Typically, these are used to set a color either for the foreground of an element (i.e., its text) or else for the background of the element. They can also be used to affect the color of borders and other decorative effects.</p>
                <h3>CSS Colors - Hex Codes:</h3>
                <p>A hexadecimal is a 6 digit representation of a color. The first two digits(RR) represent a red value, the next two are a green value(GG), and the last are the blue value(BB).</p>
                <p>A hexadecimal value can be taken from any graphics software like Adobe Photoshop, Jasc Paintshop Pro, or even using Advanced Paint Brush.</p>
                <p>Each hexadecimal code will be preceded by a pound or hash sign '#'. Following are the examples to use Hexadecimal notation.</p>
                <h3>CSS Colors - Short Hex Codes:</h3>
                <p>This is a shorter form of the six-digit notation. In this format, each digit is replicated to arrive at an equivalent six-digit value. For example: #6A7 becomes #66AA77.</p>
                <p>A hexadecimal value can be taken from any graphics software like Adobe Photoshop, Jasc Paintshop Pro, or even using Advanced Paint Brush.</p>
                <p>Each hexadecimal code will be preceded by a pound or hash sign '#'. Following are the examples to use Hexadecimal notation.</p>

                <h2>CSS Fonts</h2>
                <p>This chapter teaches you how to set fonts of a content, available in an HTML element. You can set following font properties of an element −</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <code>font-family</code> property is used to change the face of a font.</li>
                    <li>The <code>font-style</code> property is used to make a font italic or oblique.</li>
                    <li>The <code>font-variant</code> property is used to create a small-caps effect.</li>
                    <li>The <code>font-weight</code> property is used to increase or decrease how bold or light a font appears.</li>
                    <li>The <code>font-size</code> property is used to increase or decrease the size of a font.</li>
                    <li>The <code>font</code> property is used as shorthand to specify a number of other font properties.</li>
